# Hi, I'm √Ångel Gabriel N√∫√±ez Beltr√© üëã

Welcome to my portfolio! I began my journey into programming at the age of 14, during high school, where I enrolled in a technical baccalaureate program focused on software development. It was there that I was first introduced to HTML and CSS, and my passion for coding took off. 

Currently, I'm pursuing my studies at the **Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de las Am√©ricas** while continuing to grow my expertise in web development. With over five years of hands-on experience, and more than a year of professional work, I specialize in building high-performance websites and web applications. My skills include:

- **Front-end technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Astro, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Back-end development**: Node.js and related frameworks.

Some of my notable projects include **Enigmatic**, a matrix encryption tool, along with other web-based solutions aimed at solving real-world problems.

Based in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, I‚Äôm ambitious and constantly eager to learn new things with the goal of solving more complex challenges through software. I'm currently open to work opportunities where I can leverage my skills to create impactful solutions.

Let's connect and build something great together!
